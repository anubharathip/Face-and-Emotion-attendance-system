# Face-and-Emotion-attendance-system code explanation 

main.py

Imports:

cv2: OpenCV library for computer vision
numpy: Numerical computation library
face_recognition: Facial recognition library
os: Operating system interaction library
datetime: Date and time handling library
mysql.connector: MySQL database connection library
Preprocessing:

Load images: The code reads images from a directory called "input image" and stores their filenames and paths.
Encode faces: Each image is converted to RGB format and encoded using the face_recognition library. These encodings capture the unique facial features of each person.
Attendance Marking:

Attendance function: The markAttendance function takes a person's name as input and updates an attendance file ("attendance.csv") with their attendance timestamp. It also inserts the record into a MySQL database table named face_attendance1.
Main Loop:

Capture webcam feed: The program opens the webcam and captures frames continuously.
Detect faces: Each frame is resized and analyzed for faces using the face_recognition library.
Encode detected faces: The detected faces are encoded and compared to the known encodings generated earlier.
Match identification: If a match is found, the person's name is displayed on the webcam frame, and their attendance is marked. If not, "Not Found" is displayed.
Visualization: Rectangles and text labels are drawn on the webcam frame to highlight detected faces and their names.
Key points:

The program assumes the "input image" directory contains individual pictures of each person.
It relies on a MySQL database for storing attendance records.
The code captures frames at a reduced resolution for faster processing.
Overall, this code demonstrates a basic implementation of face recognition for attendance marking. It can be further customized to suit specific needs, such as handling multiple cameras, integrating with existing attendance systems, or implementing additional security measures.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions about specific parts of the code.


mysql.py

The provided code is very similar to the previous one, but with some key differences:

1. Database table: The code now uses a different database table named face_attendance instead of face_attendance1.

2. Error handling: The code now attempts to connect to the MySQL database and handle potential connection errors.

3. Attendance update: Instead of directly writing to the CSV file, the code updates the attendance record in the database upon successful face recognition.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

markAttendance function:
Attempts to connect to the MySQL database.
Uses the updated table name face_attendance.
Commits the changes to the database after inserting the attendance record.
Updates the CSV file only after successful database update.
4. Improved robustness:

The code now checks if the database connection is established before attempting to insert records.
It handles potential errors while connecting to the database or executing SQL queries.
Overall, the updated code exhibits improved robustness and data integrity by relying primarily on the database for attendance records. It still maintains the functionality of capturing webcam frames, detecting faces, marking attendance for recognized individuals, and displaying feedback on the webcam feed.

compare.py

This code snippet performs basic face recognition on two images:

1. Loading images:

It uses face_recognition to load two images from files: spb.jpg and ravi.jpeg.
Both images are converted to RGB format for processing.
2. Face detection and encoding:

The code finds the face location and encodes the facial features of Vijay in spb.jpg using face_recognition.
It then draws a green rectangle around the detected face.
Similarly, it finds the face and encodes the features of Ravi in ravi.jpeg, drawing a blue rectangle around the face.
3. Face comparison:

The code compares the encoded features of Vijay and Ravi using face_recognition.compare_faces.
It also calculates the face distance, a measure of similarity between the two faces.
4. Results and visualization:

The code prints the comparison results (True/False) and the face distance.
It then overlays the comparison results and face distance on ravi.jpeg with text and color.
Finally, it displays both images (vijay and ravi) on separate windows using cv2.imshow.
In summary, this code demonstrates basic face recognition by comparing two images and providing visual feedback on the results.

Here are some additional points to consider:

The code assumes there is only one face per image.
The accuracy of the comparison depends on various factors like image quality, lighting, and facial expressions.
This code serves as a basic example and can be extended to more complex scenarios involving multiple faces, databases, and real-time applications.
